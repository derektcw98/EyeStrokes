# EyeStrokes
Eye Strokes System for Recognizing Mandarin Characters

# Detailed Test Procedure

1. Training
      - a) Brief the participant on the experiment procedure and flow without exposing or explaining to them the GUI and how to use it. 
      - b) Educate the user on the 2 types of eye gaze inputs that the system accepts which is the eye movement and eye gaze dwelling.
2. System Setup
      - a) Laptop and Tobii eye tracker were physically set up and the participant is seated at the correct position
      - b) Participant’s eye profile is calibrated with the Tobii eye tracker
3. Testing
      - a) Task is given and participant proceeds to perform said task
         - i) Participant is not allowed to ask for help in completing tasks
         - ii) Participant is free to start and stop working on said task at any point
      - b) Step a is repeated until all tasks are complete
4. Survey
      - a) A short survey is done by the participant with regards to the user experience when performing the tasks

#### There were a total of 3 tasks given to the participants, each with its unique purpose to evaluate certain outcomes. Generally, each tasks’ flow was to have the participant drawing on, undoing or clearing the canvas and then, if the tasked Chinese character appears in the Prediction Buttons, they will trigger the corresponding button to signify the successful completion of the task. In every task, the participant’s and application performance are common outcomes to be evaluated. The Chinese Characters tasked and each of their unique insight to be identified were as follows:

1. User is to draw '一'
      - a) Evaluate intuitiveness of Start and Prediction Buttons, Canvas, Visual and Audio Cues
2. User is to draw '十'
      - a) Evaluate intuitiveness and usefulness of Undo and Clear Buttons
3. User is to draw '床'
      - a) Evaluate usefulness of Undo and Clear Buttons
      - b) Fatigue levels when drawing more complex Chinese Characters

#### Firstly, in Task 1, the expected outcome is that the participant can interact with the application with a fresh lens and successfully complete an easy task that should only require 1 horizontal stroke to achieve the Chinese character '一'. The successful completion of Task 1 would imply that the Start and Prediction Buttons, Canvas, Visual and Audio Cues were intuitive enough to achieve a successful completion of the task.

#### Subsequently, in Task 2, the expected outcome is to observe if the participant would add on 1 vertical stroke to achieve the Chinese character '十' or would they utilise the Undo or Clear buttons to start from scratch. Their choice would imply the intuitiveness and usefulness of Undo and Clear Buttons. Since they are already acquainted with the other elements in the GUI, the focus in subsequent tasks is on evaluating the intuitiveness and usefulness of Undo and Clear Buttons.

#### Lastly, in Task 3, the expected outcome is to observe interactions when tasked with a slightly more complex Chinese character like '床'. The number of uses of the Start, Undo and Clear buttons would indicate the difficulty of such a task. 

#### Besides the purposeful intentions of selecting those particular Chinese characters for the test just discussed, they are also selected from the Final Chinese character pool as they are relatively basic Chinese characters, therefore should keep the tasks simple and quick to complete.

# CNN Model Training Function

1. Add a convolutional layer with 32 filters of size 3x3, using ReLU activation
      - Finds important patterns in the images, enabling the model to capture meaningful features and representations
2. Add a max pooling layer with a pool size of 2x2
      - Reduce the size of the patterns found to keep and focus on the most important ones
3. Add another convolutional layer with 64 filters of size 3x3, using ReLU activation
      - Find more complex and higher-level patterns using another layer
4. Add another max pooling layer
      - Further reduce the pattern size to emphasize the most salient details and important aspects of the data	
5. Flatten the output of the convolutional layers
      - Reshapes the multidimensional output from the previous layers into a one-dimensional vector, making it easier to process in the subsequent layers
6. Add a fully connected layer with 128 units, using ReLU activation
      - Connect the patterns together to understand their relationships and learn complex patterns and dependencies
7. Add a Dropout layer with a rate of 0.5
      - Helps to prevent overfitting by reducing the reliance on specific features to improving model generalization
8. Add the output layer with the number of classes taken as a parameter, using the SoftMax activation function
      - Make the final predictions based on the learned patterns and The SoftMax activation function ensures that the predicted probabilities sum up to one, enabling the model to make confident class assignments
9. Compile the model with the Adam optimizer and the Categorical Cross Entropy loss function
      - Make the model learn and improve using a combination of well-established and effective techniques
